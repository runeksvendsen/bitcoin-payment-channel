--  1 satoshi = 1e-8 bitcoin. 1e8 satohis = 1 bitcoin.
--  Only amounts >= 0 can be represented, and 'fromInteger' caps to a 'Word64'.
--  It is thus not possible to eg. construct a negative BtcAmount which, when added to
--  another BtcAmount, subtracts from its value. Adding two large amounts together will
--  never overflow, nor will subtraction underflow.
